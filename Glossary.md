## Lagrangian method :

The Lagrangian method is used to solve a constrained optimization model by 
breaking the main problem in subproblems without any constraint .

A good example :

## neighboring particles :

The neighbor within a defined range are attract to each other.

## kinematic viscosity :

It is the ratio of viscosity of a fluid without any force involved.
Kinematic viscosity can be obtained by dividing the absolute viscosity of a fluid with the fluid mass density like.


## material derivative :

describes the time rate of change of some physical quantity (like heat or momentum)
of a material element that is subjected to a space-and-time-dependent velocity field.
